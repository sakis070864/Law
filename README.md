# Law
DANISH-JURA is designed by Sakis Athan to help students and lawyers use it as a         
reference point for Danish law in order to help them define the law to apply it in     
their cases. The app itself can be a bit slow sometimes because it must search         
millions of pages through thousands of sources. The program requires an API key from   
Chat GPT to function. You can obtain the API key from the following address:
